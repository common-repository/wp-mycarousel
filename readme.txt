Create with ease customizable and responsive carousel sliders.

== Description ==

WP MyCarousel is a multisite (network) plug-in that allows you to create for your website a responsive carousel having unlimited number of slides. All you have to do is to choose the sliding effect, few images, eventually to customize few attributes and that's all. You may insert a carousel anywhere in a post or a single page or any other part of your blog.

= Major features included in WP MyCarousel = 

* Supports unlimited carousel definitions
* Supports unlimited slides per carousel
* Autoplay support (with progress feedback) and manual navigation
* Supports four sliding effects : fade, slide, flip-horizontally, flip-vertically
* no JavaScript; it uses only CSS stylesheets (thus it uses hardward acceleration)
* carousel layout and navigation elements customization (size, color, shadow)
* support for usage of inline shortcode in your posts (eg. `[wp-mycarousel id="123"]`)
* support for individual slider description|annotation|link triggered at mouse events
* support for JavaScript custom code execution on slide mouse click event

> It was tested and works with IE8+ and all versions of Chrome, Firefox or Opera. It works both on desktop systems as well as on mobile devices. Works on any IIS6+/Apache/Nginx web server that has PHP5.3+ and WordPress 3.5+. Nonetheless it is WordPress multisite aware.

= How it works =

1. First create a carousel by clicking `Add New` button (specify a name, effect, eventually its size or some other custom attributes).
2. Add one/many slides with images from your WordPress Media Library (eventually specify an URL to visit at on-click event).
3. Insert the shortcode anywhere in your WordPress page/post like: `[wp-mycarousel id="123"]`, where "123" is the unique ID of carousel.
